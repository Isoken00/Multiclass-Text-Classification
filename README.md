# Multiclass-Text-Classification
## Multiclass Text Classification Using Naives Bayes

### Business Overview
Natural Language Processing, often abbreviated as NLP, gives the ability to machines to understand, read, and get meaningful insights from human language.

### Aim
This project aims to give you a brief overview of text classification where there are more than two classes available and build a classification model on processed data using the Naive Bayes algorithm. This project also explains the working of the Naive Bayes algorithm and related terminology.
It will also help us to understand the Naive Bayes algorithm and build a multiclass classification model.

### Data Description
The dataset contains more than two million customer complaints about consumer financial products. Amongst the various available columns, we have a column that contains the actual text of the complaint and one column containing the product for which the customer is raising the complaint.

### Tech Stack
➔ Language: Python

➔ Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, nltk

### Approach
1. Introduction to Naive Bayes algorithm
2. Data Description and visualization
3. Data Preprocessing
a. Conversion to lower case
b. Tokenization
c. Stopwords removal
d. Punctuation removal
4. Model Building and Accuracy
5. Predictions on new reviews

#### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a classification technique that is based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption that all the features that predicts the target value are independent of each other. It calculates the probability of each class and then pick the one with the highest probability. It is a supervised learning algorithm.


#### Naive Bayes Theorem
 
Bayes’ Theorem is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities.

Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring given that another event has (by assumption, presumption, assertion, or evidence) occurred.
In simpler terms, Bayes’ Theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.
